Meteoric Marisa (Touhou) by Deoxgigas

After 10000 years, I have returned from my retirement to deliver a new character out of the HD Touhou fighting game series.
If you're looking for a proper balanced character who you'd find in a regular fighting game, I'm afraid this ain't where you'll find it.
I'm sure that some people who remember my former works would've preferred another BlazBlue character, but this time I wanted to return to my roots and make something...
Stronger. With less effort. And yet still quite alot of effort. Getting the combos right on this one turned out to be quite the handful.

Meteoric Marisa is, like Flash Byakuren and Zen Kasen Ibaraki before her, directly inspired by her namesake of Touhou 13.5 HM and Touhou 14.5 ULiL. 
She has all the moves from the source game, except the Occult move from 14.5 which I swapped out for something more in line with the theme I was going for here.
In addition, she has the same kind of Bomb super that my other Touhou characters have, her 3 supers from ULiL, her Last Word spell from HM, and a new grab super. 

The AI is as relentless as ever, designed for AI vs AI fights.
